                <p class="bio"> This is my  Portofile. In each section I tried to describe myself.</p>
                <h2>About Me</h2>
                <p>My name is Nardos Worku. I am 16 years old. I am a grade 11 student. I am currently learning in School Of Aygoda.</p>
                <h2>Educational Background</h2>
                <p>I have grown in small family.I went to school when i was 2 years old. I learned in EmeMuzAcadamy from KG to grade 7 then I have been learing in school of aygoda since I was grade 8 student up to now. Now i am grade 11 student. I won't forget the time I get in School Of Aygoda. There was miniistry exam in grade 8 so I become serious because I was afraid I will fail. But I get 96.9% in the exam.  </p>
                <h2>My Interests</h2>
                <p>I am interested in drawing different things. Actually i am good at it. I design alot of women's dress,buildings and other things. I draw most of the time because I feel peaceful when I drew something. It really helps me to calm. I also love nature. Sometimes you may see me in the rain playing and acting childish.I also love reading fiction books.</p>
                <h3>My Goals</h3>
                <p>For the first time I saw a pilot in tv. The plane was abducted by unknown peoples. There were alot of peoples in the plane. The kidnappers try to threat the pilot to fly to america or all peoples were gone die. So he convince the kidnappers that the plane didn't have much gas to go to america and he successfully landed to unknown island without the kiddnappers knowing. He even called polices. I knew from that time he did everything to protect the peoples inside the plane. My dream is to be pilot because there is alot of accidents that occur when people travel in plane and i want to have the required knowledge to be pilot and i will try to protect my citizens. </p>
                <h2>Achivements</h2>
                <p>I have awards the were given to me from my old school because I ranked top from the whole school.i had participated in science club and i get certificate for active participation from my school. I actually working on some project I will update you soon with more details. <p>
                <h2>Contact</h2>
